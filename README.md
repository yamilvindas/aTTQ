# An asymmetric heuristic for trained ternary quantization based on the weights' statistics

## I) Introduction

GitHub repository for the sumbission of the paper *An asymmetric heuristic for trained ternary quantization based on the weights' statistics* for Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHJ) 2023.

## II) Configuration

To be able to run the different codes (Linux platforms), you need to start by running the following command:

    export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:pathToThe_aTTQ_Code"

Then, you should install the different libraries needed to execute the different codes:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
